# Neighborhood Map (React)
You will develop a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

This application follow this [Udacity Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view)

## How to run the "neighborhood-map-react-heba" project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on.
Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.
By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
